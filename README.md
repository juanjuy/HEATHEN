HEATHEN is a small project that I attempted to get a handle on some basic game development concepts:
- Platforming physics
- Implementing power-ups
- Enemy drops and pickups
- Boss battles
- Checkpoints
- Credits sequence

You can download and play it from my Itch page here: https://jascallion.itch.io/heathen
